TradingView - Remove ads

#1 - Download Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey extension for your favorite browser.

#2 - Create a new script in Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey extension copy pasting the source code of TradingViewNoAds_clearInterval_version.js or TradingViewNoAds_infiniteLoop_version.js

#3 - Enable the script in the Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey extension while being on the Tradingview website (if it has not been done yet by default).

Those source codes work and have only been tested with Google Chrome browser on Windows 11, consequently I did not test it yet on any smartphone's browser.
